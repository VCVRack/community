## How to

You can find information on that plugins pack in the [wiki](https://github.com/sebastien-bouffier/Bidoo/wiki). When doing tests it happens that I record a video so you may find some ideas on how to use those modules [here](https://www.youtube.com/bidoo).

## Last changes

0.6.0dev

ACnE update: Rotary faders follow values when changing snapshots via cv. You can record snapshots live (faders movements) under cv automation. Added Ramp parameter for smooth transitions between snapshots.
tOCAnTe : First step on the journey to clocks. So it is a simple clock with quarters triplets (1/12) and measure management.
pANARd : First version of a live sampling/mangling module.

To compile first launch a "make dep" to retrieve mpg123 lib.
