- Parasites skins + libary:
  - access to Parasites firmwares by Matthias Puech https://mqtthiqs.github.io/parasites/
  - based on Aepelzens Parasites / (P)arable Instruments
  - indicated by more Lovecraftian font and logo to differentiate from original firmwares
  - Smoke (Clouds): Smoke, Espectro, Ritardo, Camilla, Oliverb, Resonestor
  - Splash: Splash, Two Bumps, Two Drunks

- Mutable Instruments skins
  - rename Humo back to Smoke 
     (don't want too many new names - should be ok to use original names for alternative modes / parasites)
  - skins for all modes
  - add back VU meter

  - Annuli
    - add skin for Disastrous Peace easter egg mode

- Riemann
  - chord generator based on Neo-Riemannian Tonnetz analysis
  - inspired by NE Tonnetz Sequent, Navichord app, o_C Automatonnetz 
    (and my incapability to compose / improvise diatonic music)
  - Traversal via perfect fifth (P5/V) per volt and major triad per volt (M3/V) inputs  
  - Major/minor, Augmented/diminished chord groups
  - 3 - 7 parts per chord (from standard triads to thirteenth chords)
  - Parts mostly display for now, outputs after last part output root note
  - Switch for suspensions (sus4) close to fifth-axis
  - Transpose rotates within octave
  - Outputs in V/oct
  - Tonic output (T) for tonic drone
  - Voicing inc/decreases octaves to the right/left sequentially by part 
    (small settings to the right give chord inversions)

- Etagère
  - swap LP/HP position
  - update cosmetics

- Deux Etagères
  - convenience stereo version of Etagère

- Gnome
  - improved internal gain staging and mixing behavior
  - crossfading between oscillator and sub-oscillator
  - improved range for PWM behavior
  - VCF resonance gain-compensation
  - updated skin cosmetics (closer to original color scheme...)

- SNS
  - CLK/RST thru added for easier chaining of multiple SNS

- Snake
  - introduce 16 internal busses 0-F with 10 lines per buss
  - cosmetics, separate 2x5 lines
  - fix muting on unplugging / buss change

- Falls
  - Attenumixverter, inspired by Fonitronik Cascade
  - empty inputs provide offset voltages
  - empty outputs mix into output below

- Aux
  - 2 stereo effect send/return loops 
  - with cross feedback (same or swapped stereo channels)
  - mute button for input (to listen to those sweet reverb tails)
  - bypass button for fx (in case you went wild with the feedback pots)  

-- 0.5.2 ----

- Gnome: complete synth voice based on Fundamental modules

- Snake: multicore (experimental!) introduces a small delay!
  if in doubt check the difference signal of in and output.
  a particular port is locked by the instance where the cable gets plugged first (green light).
  this signal is then available at all other instances (red light).

- Humo (standard Clouds): new skins for the alternate modes: Espectro, Ritardo, Camilla

- Sssh: 4 copies of the noise/S+H section from Kinks, normalized

- Fuse: fixes to gate/trigger behavior

- Blank panels: 1HP, 2HP, 4HP, 8HP, 16HP, 42HP - nothing special for now but watch this space
