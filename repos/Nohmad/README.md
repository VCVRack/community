# Nohmad
Nohmad is a collection virtual modules for VCV Rack. Since I'm using these modules as an opportunity to learn new stuff, you can expect most modules to be somewhat tied up to a specific mathematical and/or signal processing concept. Nohmad is currently a work in progress and more modules will be added as time goes by.

**Strange Attractors:** A split panel oscillator module implemented using the [Lorenz](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/LorenzAttractor.html) and [Rossler](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/RoesslerAttractor.html) chaotic attractors.

**Noise:** A noise generator based on the [Quantum Rainbow 2](http://www.steadystatefate.com/quantum-rainbow-2) eurorack module by Steady State Fate.
